# Water_Demand_Forecasting
Efficient management of water resources in both urban and rural regions relies heavily on accurate demand forecasting. This project leverages machine learning to predict short-term and long-term water consumption patterns using Python and popular open-source libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Prophet, and XGBoost.

🔑 Key Features

📈 Time-Series Forecasting: Predict water demand on daily, weekly, or hourly scales.

🌦️ External Factor Integration: Incorporate variables like temperature, humidity, and holidays to improve accuracy.

🧠 Multiple ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, and Prophet.

🛠️ Data Pipeline: Automated preprocessing and feature engineering.

📊 Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, and MAPE for model performance assessment.

🧪 Extensible Framework: Easily retrain or adapt models to custom datasets.
